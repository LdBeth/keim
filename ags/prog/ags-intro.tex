\section{Introduction}

As we started work on this project, we found that there were some things
that probably would be useful in any of our projects, whether or not they were
involved with \keim\ or even theorem proving.  So we put them here in 
this section. 

One of them is the {\tt SYS} module.  This should include all 
system-dependent function definitions.  Particularly important is the
definition of an error-handling system, based on the ANSI standard,
but defined  so old \lisp{s} can still use it. 

Another set of modules is used for extracting documentation from the 
\lisp\ source files.  This includes the modules {\tt DOC}, for the
general functionality, and the modules {\tt DOCA} for ASCII documentation
and {\tt DOCL} for \LaTeX\ documentation.
