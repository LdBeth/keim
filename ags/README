This is the most basic system included with KEIM.  It contains mostly
service-related stuff, keeping tracking of modules, for example, 
pretty-printing, and documentation.

The subdirectory fasl/ will contain all compiled files for the system.
The subdirectory tex/  will contain any produced tex files.
